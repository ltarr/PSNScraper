# PSNScraper

[`psn_scraper.py`](psn_scraper.py) is where the scraping happens.

[`sale_md.py`](sale_md.py) makes Reddit comments.

[`psn_to_csv.py`](psn_to_csv.py) creates a CSV with the sale data. This is useful for uploading to something like Google Sheets.

Anything related to actually posting on Reddit has been removed.
